<p>I am a researcher at the Center for Applied Research (<a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SNF</a>) and the Center of Excellence <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAIR</a> at NHH Norwegian Schoolof Economics in Bergen, Norway. I completed my PhD at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>My research brings insights from psychology to bear on topics in economics, particularly topics relevant to developing countries. My current research agenda is centered on the economics of mental health in developing countries. Past projects include studying how improving sleep affects the economic outcomes of workers in India, how the endowment effect influences consumer demand for collateralized loans in Kenya, how research findings affect the beliefs and policy choices of mayors in Brazil, and how mixing rich and poor students in schools in India affects social preferences and behaviors.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> </span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: We find that individuals involved in low-level crime who receive prison sentences are more likely to be re-imprisoned for technical violations during their post-release supervision, rather than for new offenses, compared to those who receive non-prison sentences. We identify the extent and cost of this incapacitation effect among individuals with similar criminal histories using exogenous variation in sentence type from discontinuities in Michigan Sentencing Guidelines. Higher re-imprisonment adds 15\% more prison days to the original sentence while only low-level crimes appear to be averted. These results suggest that re-imprisonment for technical parole violations does not prevent serious crime.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> </span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: This paper examines how decision-making may change when individuals face a permanent change in financial resources after a major life transition. We experimentally elicit preference and cognitive measures from Colombian students on the job market, as well as from a comparison group of college peers in lower years, over 8 months. This period encompasses the job search process while students are in college and ends after they graduate and begin their full-time jobs. Using a difference-in-differences setup, we find that students entering the job market perceive greater financial liquidity and take on more responsibilities. We do not find any evidence of an increase in the take-up of credit or of students moving out of their parents’ homes, features commonly associated with this transition in other countries. Regarding preferences, we find suggestive evidence that the students become less present biased and more prosocial during this transition to the workforce. We do not find significant changes in risk and ambiguity preferences or cognitive performance. These findings help us document the changes experienced during a universal transition, one that is achieved through own effort rather than cash transfers or government policies.</span></p>

In a series of incentivized lab experiments, we ask participants to guess the color composition of balls in an urn after drawing balls with replacement. Participants&#39; guesses are substantially less sensitive to draws made by another player compared to draws made themselves. This result holds when others&#39; signals must be learned through discussion, when they are perfectly communicated by the experimenter, and even when participants see their teammate drawing balls from the urn with their own eyes. We find a crucial role for  taking some action to generate one&#39;s `own&#39; information, and rule out distrust, confusion, errors in probabilistic thinking, up-front inattention and imperfect recall as channels.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Kevin Carney, Michael Kremer and Xinyue Lin)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: May 2022</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Revise and Resubmit, Econometrica</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(12)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_12"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_12" style="display:none;">: Collateral requirements play an important role in credit markets. This paper shows that the endowment effect---the phenomenon where owing a good increases one&#39;s valuation of it---inhibits demand for loans which use a borrower&#39;s existing assets as collateral. Using a field experiment in Kenya, we show that borrowers instead strongly prefer loans collateralized using the new durable assets being financed by the loans themselves. They are willing to pay 9% per month higher interest for such Same-Asset Collateralized Loans (SACLs) despite the endowed and new assets being randomized, and thus similarly valued before ownership. Our findings imply that assets which are difficult to use as collateral---which cannot be financed by SACLs---will be invested in less, even if the borrower has other collateral. We argue that borrowers&#39; preference for SACLs is driven by naivete: they initially perceive that they have little to lose when offered a SACL, but subsequently come to develop an attachment to the new asset, resulting in high repayment effort. Consistent with this, borrowers underestimate their future attachment to an asset before owning it, and SACLs do not have higher default rates despite having higher demand. We derive the conditions under which offering consumers SACLs increases or conversely decreases borrower welfare.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(13)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_13"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_13" style="display:none;">: Do spouses pool useful information and  learn from each other when they have incentives to do so? In an experiment with married couples in India, we vary whether individuals discover information themselves or must instead learn what their spouse discovered via a discussion. Women treat their own and their husband&#39;s information the same. In contrast, men respond half as much to information discovered by their wife, even when it is perfectly communicated. When paired with strangers, both men and women heavily discount their partner&#39;s information relative to their own. We thus provide evidence of a gender difference in social learning (only)  in the household.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: April 2022</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(14)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_14"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_14" style="display:none;">: We revisit two clinical trials that randomized depressed adults in India (n=775) to a brief course of psychotherapy or a control condition. Four to five years later, the treatment group had 11 percentage points less depression than the control group. The more effective intervention averted 9 months of depression on average over five years and cost only \$66. Therapy changed people&#39;s beliefs about themselves in three ways. First, it reduced their likelihood of seeing themselves as a failure or feeling bad about themselves. Second, when faced with a novel work opportunity, therapy reduced over-optimistic belief updating and thus reduced overconfidence. Third, it increased self-assessed levels of patience and altruism. Therapy did not increase levels of employment or consumption, possibly because of other constraints on employment in the largely female study sample.
